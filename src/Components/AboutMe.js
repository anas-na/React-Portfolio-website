        Born and raised in Morocco, I moved to NYC in 2010 and been living in
        the big apple ever since. with a passion for music, I started learning
        about coding in middle school with having my own blog where i posted all
        music news that interest me. but now i chose to imerse myself more into
        programing and be orofessional at it. I love being able to expand my
        horizons and see what's possible. My curiosity and drive for perfection
        means that I excel at solving technical challenges and debugging
        individual lines of code. Ultimately, I hope to use my technical skills
        to design and program my own video games, and to build platforms that
        enable community building and social impact.
